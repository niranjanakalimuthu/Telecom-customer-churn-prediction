# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior, contract details, and service usage patterns, the model identifies customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

##  Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry. The goal is to build a predictive model that classifies whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.
